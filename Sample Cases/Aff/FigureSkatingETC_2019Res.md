Psychological egoism, the idea that humans are motivated by self-interest and selfishness, is highly prevalent in society. Despite having good morals or values, at the end of the day, the most important person to you is yourself.

Helping others is a two way street. The “I help you, you help me” mentality is ingrained in people’s minds, creating reciprocity of mutual benefit. People will help others only if it means gaining something in return. Of course, this is completely unintentional, but in the back of people’s minds, they know that if they do someone else a favor, that person will feel obligated to eventually do something in return. The classic, “thank you, I owe you one” clearly expresses this as people naturally feel indebted to those who help them. Therefore, kind gestures are not acts of altruism. They are ulterior motives for people to gain personal benefit.

Even kind acts towards strangers are not completely genuine. As people were raised to be morally right, they instinctively act on these values to satisfy their conscious. However, they will help others because they were _taught_ to do so, not because they _inherently_ need to. Society tell us the proper way to act and how to treat people but no one truly _wants_ to go out of their way to help a person they don’t even know. People do kind things because they believe they have to.

<h1>CONTENTION 3</h1>

People will immediately make sacrifices to help their loved ones, however this is still done out of self interest. You obviously make decisions based on your established connections, such as your friends and family. But this is because their lives have a direct influence on YOU, so anything that happens to them affects _your_ happiness and _your_ relationship with them. Therefore, helping and making sacrifices for loved ones is not necessarily to improve their lives; it is to improve their perception of YOU as YOU are the one providing the help. People say they will “take a bullet” for someone they love. However, they are actually thinking of themself in this statement because they know how much pain and sorrow THEY would endure if such person were to leave their life and they would rather die than experience such emotion.

Children are the prime example of human behavior because they are less influenced and corrupted by society. For bullying to be so prevalent among kids shows that kindness and altruism do not naturally prevail. Many kids, even the victim’s friends, remain bystanders out of fear of what the bully would do to them. They do not want another person to be hurt, however they naturally just care more about themself and their own well-being.

Lord of the Flies is a perfect depiction of children succumbing to the human instinct of selfishness for means of survival. They initially try to create a civilization with order and rules, however, without an actual society to enforce such rules, they quickly give in to the innate human tendency of savagery. Every character fends only for himself, without a second thought on how others are affected. This proves that society and civilization only suppress selfish instincts but when left alone and free, humans will naturally only care for themselves.

In addition, science concludes that altruism is not an innate human characteristic and children are born selfish. According to a joint study by Yale University and University of Chicago where a group of 5-year-olds were observed, the kids were “strikingly ungenerous” as they chose “better” stickers for themselves when others were not looking.

One’s reputation also plays a huge role in human behavior and interaction. In order to acquire a positive reputation and be perceived as a “good” and “moral” human being, one must exhibit such behaviors. Being kind, making sacrifices for others, and helping others without being asked are just a few actions a person with a good reputation would make. As people desperately strive for society to view them in a positive light, they therefore make efforts to become this perfect person for others to like and approve of. However, this is only a mask, and does not demonstrate that person’s true qualities or behaviors. They are simply forcing themself to act a certain way in order to obtain this desired reputation.

<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>

Humans are clearly driven by selfishness as every action they make is intended to somehow benefit themself. While such actions may often be perceived as kind or altruistic, the underlying motivations behind this behavior is always driven by some form of self interest.
